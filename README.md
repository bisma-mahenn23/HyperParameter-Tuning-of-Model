# HyperParameter-Tuning-of-Model

This project focuses on improving ML model performance through Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

# Project Overview

Hyperparameters are key to getting the best out of machine learning models. This project tunes a Spam Email Classifier using:
- Grid Search for exhaustive tuning
- Random Search for faster exploration
- Classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM

# Project Objectives

- Train a classifier to detect spam emails.
- Tune model performance by experimenting with different hyperparameters.
- Evaluate the model using precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
- Implement both **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** for optimization.

# Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# Results

- Best Parameters found using Grid Search and Random Search
- F1 Score improved after tuning
- High performance confirmed with cross-validation

# HyperParameter-Tuning-of-Model

This project focuses on improving ML model performance through Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

# Overview

Hyperparameters are key to getting the best out of machine learning models. This project tunes a Spam Email Classifier using:
- Grid Search for exhaustive tuning
- Random Search for faster exploration
- Classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM

# Objectives

- Understand the importance of hyperparameters in ML
- Use GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV from scikit-learn
- Improve metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

# Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

| Method        | Time        | Accuracy |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Grid Search   | Slower      | ✅✅✅ |
| Random Search | Much Faster | ✅✅    |
